# REACT NATIVE CAMERA ü™ê

This package has been forked from the react-native-camera package.

**Reasons:**</br>
**1-** The react-native-camera package is not being continued.</br>
**2-** Alternative packages do not fully meet the need.</br>
**3-** The latest version of the current package does not meet the requirement.

**NEW FEATURES:**</br>
Limit the scanning area. This speeds up scans.</br>
The center of the screen will be cut off vertically and horizontally.</br>
